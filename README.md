Just another repository

Hello everyone,

My name is Andrew Davis and I am a PhD student studying the underlying genetics of skin cancer using mouse models and human cancer cell lines. I am interested in learning coding and bioinformatics, so that I may be able to analyze, visualize, and understand large omics datasets that I and others have generated.
